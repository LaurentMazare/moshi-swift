## moshi-swift

[Moshi][moshi] is a speech-text foundation model and **full-duplex** spoken dialogue framework.
It uses [Mimi][moshi], a state-of-the-art streaming neural audio codec. Mimi processes 24 kHz audio, down to a 12.5 Hz representation
with a bandwidth of 1.1 kbps, in a fully streaming manner (latency of 80ms, the frame size).


This repo contains **experimental** implementations of these models using [MLX
Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift):
- Fully streaming implementation of the mimi codec.
- Support for all moshi variants.

The main goal of this repo is to make it easy to experiment with these models
on ios devices. An ios app is included but it's only a proof of concept.

Compile and test using the command line:
```bash
make run-1b
```

The checkpoints are automatically downloaded from the huggingface hub. So you
may have to wait for a bit when running the model for the first time.

### Possible workarounds for common issues
`LD_RUNPATH_SEARCH_PATHS` has been set in xcode to include the executable path
which is where the `moshi-lib` framework seems to be compiled.

When running on the command line via ssh, this may require unlocking the keychain with:
```
security unlock-keychain
```

Added to `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS` `-no-verify-emitter-module-interface`,
as per [github issue](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift/issues/64669).
